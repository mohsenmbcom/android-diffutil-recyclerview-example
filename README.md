#DiffUtil  RecyclerView Example

We have a RecyclerView which includes two sections arranged vertically. Generally, we will show Items containing two `string` parameters, named `title` and `description`. Also, we wil have one `boolean` parameter named `bookmarked`.



**List Sections** 

Section #1: This section is set to show bookmarked items.

Section #2: This section is set to show all the items.

Each section will contain elements which have one `CheckBox` and two `TextView`s.
If the user checks the `CheckBox`, it will be added to bookmarked items section and vice versa.
